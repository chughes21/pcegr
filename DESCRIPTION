Description: This package contains functions to fit Poisson Chain EVent Graphs (PCEGs) and Zero Inflated PCEGs (ZIPCEGs). The functions can be used when observation time is uniform or variable. If observation time is uniform, it can be either excluded or included as equal for each individual. If it is variable, the time must be the last column in the data set.
